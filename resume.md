A cartographic representation of "The View From Your Window", a regular photo feature on [Andrew Sullivan's The Dish](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/). Each post is parsed, geotagged, and organized by date posted and time of day, then displayed on a map to be explored.

Final project at Dev Bootcamp which I pitched, managed, and developed as part of a team. ScrallWall combines mapping, geolocation, user-generated content, and open city data and APIs to allow users to share and discover found art. This project used a variety of self-taught technologies outside of Dev Bootcamp's curriculum including Open311 APIs, PostGIS, and Mapbox.js.
